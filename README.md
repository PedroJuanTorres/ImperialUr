## Solution
Using the MVC method to write the program and organize the classes, we came up with 2 Model classes (Squares and Player), that will serve as the base for the whole game. After that we created a Controller Class to control the flow of the program and guide both the View and the Model. A View was created and modified so the game would have a better appeal to the users.

We didn't discuss with other groups about the project



## Notes
Most of the work was made during calls on discord with all members of the group and because we didn't have enough experience with how git functions we ended up not realising that sending commits troughtout the making of the program was obligatory so we ended up making all the commits on the last day, when we were re-reading what the teacher asked and realized our mistake.
