We didn't discuss with other groups about the project

## Notes
Most of the work was made during calls on discord with all members of the group and because we didn't have enough experience with how git functions we ended up not realising that sending commits troughtout the making of the program was obligatory so we ended up making all the commits on the last day, when we were re-reading what the teacher asked and realized our mistake.
